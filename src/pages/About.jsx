            <hr />
                <p>I'm a full-stack engineer from Smyrna, Georgia - leveraging product, marketing, and tech-startup entrepreneurship experience to create digital experiences that delight and inspire.</p>
                <p>Recently enrolled in the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, Fall 2020 cohort; I have an array of new technical skills to include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, AJAX, MySQL, Express-Handlebars, and JSON.
                </p>
                <p>Peers agree that I have a real knack for understanding complex concepts and seeing through to the root of an issue. In each new application, I invest myself fully to writing clean and understandable code with a focus on the clientsâ€™ side usability and UI.
                </p>
                <p>I've utilized my newfound skills to help a team of four create a client side application that implemented multiple client-side AJAX calls to harmonize job search data with apartment rental data based on user inputs. 
                    
                Another highlight was in creating a user-seeding travel resource app called CulTourist. It integrates custom helpers using Express-Handlebars, full CRUD Routes, is supported by a custom built JAWSDB database with MySQL and Sequelize ORM, as well as pulling in 3rd party API data from RESTCountries.Eu. 
                
                I am ready to put my powerful blend of soft and technical skills to use as part of a value driven, innovative, web-development team.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me spending time running after my 3 year old son, making silly faces for my 7 month old daughter, or having a glass of wine with my wife.</p>
                <p>Let's connect and have a conversation. </p>
