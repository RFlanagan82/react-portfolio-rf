## Description
The portfolio site contained in this repository has been created from the skills I've learned thus far within the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp - Fall 2020 cohort.

This site contains 4 pages to include:

- [Index Page](https://rflanagan82.github.io/react-portfolio-rf/)
- [About Page](https://rflanagan82.github.io/react-portfolio-rf/about)
- [Resume Page]()
- [Portfolio](https://rflanagan82.github.io/react-portfolio-rf/portfolio)
- [Contact]()

The site also contains a link to my latest resume as a PDF file.

## Credits & Contributions
Thank you to TA - Peter Colella for helping me set up my props for the social box images on the home page and correct the links.

Thank you to TA - Leif Hetland for helping me with some CSS and formatting issues on my footer and contact page.

Thanks to my tutor for helping me with some of my path issues and fixing the architecture of my react app.

## Challenges

On the local server I can get my resume to populate in the page as shown here...

But when I get it loaded and go to the Resume page I get a 404.

Troubleshooted but unable to fix yet.
